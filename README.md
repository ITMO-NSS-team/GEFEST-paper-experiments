# GEFEST-paper-experiments
The repository contains the experimental studies for "Evolutionary Generative Design of Physical Objects with GEFEST framework" paper.

The experimental setup consists of:

- Synthetic cases:
  - design of structures with various number of polygons in optimal solution - [script](./synthetic/num_polygons/number_of_objects.py)
  - design of structures with various number of vertices in optimal solution - [script](./synthetic/num_vertices/number_of_vertices.py)
  - design of structures with various number of search domain size - [script](./synthetic/domain_size/domain_size.py)
- Breakwater design case study;
- Microfluidic device case study;
- Meat-source system design;
- Oil field design case stydy.

GEFEST framework is available in [main repository](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST).
